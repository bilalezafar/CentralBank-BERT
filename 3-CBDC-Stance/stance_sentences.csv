"another key issue is whether a cbdc should be remunerated or, as in the case of cash, should pay no interest.",Wait-and-See
"the overall effect is ambiguous, but it could be non-negligible and have non-trivial distributional consequences: central bank profits, transferred to the state and used as the state sees fit, could change 18 on the contrary, a cbdc without interest would be comparable to cash.",Wait-and-See

"yet despite being an innovation-friendly regulator, in terms of cbdcs, we do not have much inhouse projects to share, at least at this point.",Wait-and-See
"it is thus simple to define what the cbdc is not: not a conventional reserve account, and not a private crypto asset.",Wait-and-See
"the debate is whether cbdcs should be retail, or wholesale only currencies, or perhaps both.",Wait-and-See
one example would be the value-based wholesale cbdc.,Wait-and-See
another basic variation would be the value-based retail cbdc.,Wait-and-See
"thus the rationale for the wholesale cbdc could be to enhance payments and securities settlement efficiency, as well as to reduce counterparty credit and liquidity risks.",Pro-CBDC
"second, the cbdc may alleviate the effective lower bound constraint, making it possible to go deeper into the negative territory.",Pro-CBDC
"knowing this, the retail cbdc would further ensure that the funds stored in bank accounts can indeed be easily converted to risk-free central bank money.",Pro-CBDC
the issue here is that central bank money being risk-free also means that the retail cbdc would be a safe asset.,Pro-CBDC

"this variant is called ""general purpose cbdc.""",Wait-and-See
"a general purpose cbdc is a substitute for cash (banknotes and coins), and two issuing forms are possible (figure 5).",Wait-and-See
"one is an ""account-based"" cbdc, in which individuals and firms open an account at a central bank and use it to make transfers between accounts.",Wait-and-See
"for instance, in terms of monetary policy, academia, in principle, argues that cbdcs should bear interest -- even negative interest rates in some cases -- as that could increase the effectiveness of monetary policy.",Pro-CBDC
this argument is based on the premise that the level of interest rates applied to cbdc could work as the effective lower bound of interest rates for wide-ranging financial assets.,Pro-CBDC
"this is because even if a central bank applies negative interest rates to cbdc, as long as cash which yields zero interest remains, there will be a shift of funds toward cash.",Wait-and-See

"further to the above, a number of other possible advantages of cbdcs have been identified.",Pro-CBDC
"adding to the contraction in the supply of loanable funds derived from retail depositors opting to hold cbdcs instead of bank accounts, loan demand could be affected too as a result of banks' attempts to preserve margins by increasing their lending rates.",Anti-CBDC

"otherwise - even in the absence of a crisis - a readily convertible cbdc could crowd out bank deposits, leading to the disintermediation of the banking sector.",Anti-CBDC
"furthermore, a retail cbdc would create a disproportionate concentration of power in the central bank.",Anti-CBDC
these potentially highly adverse effects on the financial system would appear to outweigh the benefits envisaged by the introduction of a retail cbdc.,Anti-CBDC

some commentators argue that the united states must develop a cbdc to compete with u.s. dollar stablecoins.,Pro-CBDC
"for example, a global u.s. dollar stablecoin network could encourage use of the dollar by making cross-border payments faster and cheaper, and it potentially could be deployed much faster and with fewer downsides than a cbdc.",Anti-CBDC
"indeed, the combination of imminent improvements in the existing payments system such as various instant payments initiatives combined with the crossborder efficiency of properly structured stablecoins could well make superfluous any effort to develop a cbdc.",Anti-CBDC
some commentators assert that the united states must develop a cbdc to counter the appeal of cryptocurrencies.,Pro-CBDC
"bitcoin and its ilk will, accordingly, almost certainly remain a risky and speculative investment rather than a revolutionary means of payment, and they are therefore highly unlikely to affect the role of the u.s. dollar or require a response with a cbdc.",Anti-CBDC

"and globally, 87 4 ] countries - representing over 90% of global gdp - are currently exploring a cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
a widely held view is that cbdcs could crowd out bank deposits and payment activities.,Anti-CBDC
"first, the risks that cbdcs pose to bank intermediation depend crucially on the choices that central banks make.",Wait-and-See
"central banks can also adapt cbdc design features, which are found to be strong drivers of the 6 ] potential demand for cbdcs.",Wait-and-See
"as the demand for cash weakens, issuing cbdcs could ensure that sovereign money continues to play its role in underpinning confidence in money and payments.",Pro-CBDC
"by continuing to provide the reference value for all forms of private money in the economy, a cbdc would protect the value of 10 ] money and monetary sovereignty.",Pro-CBDC
"[ a cbdc could also improve the allocation of capital by facilitating access to payments and reducing 11 ] transaction costs, thereby helping to unlock business opportunities.",Pro-CBDC
"[ similarly, cbdcs could foster competition in banks' funding markets by reducing banks' market power and improving contractual 12 ] terms for customers, with little effect on intermediation.",Pro-CBDC
[ and cbdcs could support the digitalisation of the banking sector by facilitating innovative payment opportunities and levelling the playing field for banks that are more exposed to competition from new players like big tech firms.,Pro-CBDC
"13 since i discussed these issues over a year ago[ ], new conceptual and empirical studies have further sharpened our understanding of these broader effects of cbdcs on the economy.",Wait-and-See
"by offering an outside option to depositors, a cbdc could provide a floor on deposit rates, limiting banks' monopoly profits in the deposit market and 15 ] prompting them to increase lending.",Pro-CBDC
"[ an empirical study on the us economy suggests that by enhancing competition in deposit markets, a cbdc could raise bank lending by almost 2% and output 16 ] by about 0.2%.",Pro-CBDC
"potential effects in times of crisis however, the risks to financial intermediation from issuing cbdcs are potentially more elevated when there is a sudden loss of confidence in banks.",Anti-CBDC
research has therefore examined the extent to which cbdcs can increase depositors' sensitivity to systemic banking crises.,Wait-and-See
"ecb staff analysis, for example, suggests that adequately designing and 20 ] calibrating cbdc safeguards could help to counteract the adverse effects of cbdcs on bank runs.",Pro-CBDC
"factors that could weaken monetary policy transmission if a cbdc were issued without safeguards to constrain its use, the transmission of monetary policy could be weakened.",Anti-CBDC
"an unconstrained cbdc could potentially have an impact on the funding structure of banks, with potential implications for financing conditions.",Anti-CBDC
[ an unremunerated and unconstrained cbdc could also entrench the zero lower bound for interest rates.,Anti-CBDC
"i have stressed in the past that, if we were to issue a digital euro, we would not use it as a monetary policy instrument and we would continue to issue physical banknotes.",Pro-CBDC
main lesson to be drawn from these findings is that a cbdc would need to be carefully designed.,Wait-and-See
[ a ceiling on individual cbdc holdings could go a long way towards mitigating undesired effects on monetary policy or financial stability by preventing large deposit outflows.,Pro-CBDC
"but a cap on cbdc holdings, for example, would risk reducing the scale and scope of cbdc use and, consequently, its usefulness as a means of payment.",Anti-CBDC
[ another option would be to make remuneration on cbdc holdings less attractive above a certain 28 ] threshold.,Wait-and-See
"above that threshold, however, remuneration would be set below the main policy rate in order to reduce the attractiveness of the cbdc as a store of value relative to bank deposits or other short-term financial assets.",Wait-and-See
ecb research shows that the central bank could steer the quantity of cbdc in circulation by setting its lending and 29 ] deposit rates as well as collateral and quantity requirements.,Wait-and-See
"[ indeed, cbdc holdings and bank deposits would depend on both cbdc remuneration and policy rates.",Wait-and-See
"issuing a cbdc could also lead to a shift from bank borrowing to non-bank sources of finance, with consequences through other channels.",Wait-and-See
what about if we added new elements to the design of cbdcs and their underlying system?,Wait-and-See

the analyses presented in this paper look at different approaches for assessing the effects of a digital euro on euro area banks.,Wait-and-See
"18. the design of a digital euro would likely include a combination of tools, even if not all are necessarily activated at the time of issuance.",Wait-and-See
"19. for example, we are investigating a waterfall functionality which would allow users to receive payments in digital euro above the holding limit by linking a digital euro account to a commercial bank account.",Pro-CBDC
the waterfall approach is a way of managing end users' retail cbdc holdings via the automated conversion of retail cbdc in excess of a holding threshold into a bank deposit held in a linked commercial bank account chosen by the end user.,Pro-CBDC
"in this perspective, the banque de france has successfully conducted nine experiments with central bank digital money (cbdm) for the purpose of interbank settlement, securities transactions and cross-border payments over the past two years.",Pro-CBDC

"in addition, unlike central bank digital currencies (cbdcs), they are not backed by a central bank or any other public authority.",Wait-and-See
we are also to introduce the retail central bank digital currency (cbdc) and expect to put out a pilot program by the fourth quarter of this year.,Pro-CBDC
"we have done quite well on the wholesale cbdc, dealing with cross-border issues, and the next phase for us is to implement the retail project by preparing ourselves through this pilot project.",Pro-CBDC
we thus see the retail cbdc as an essential part of that open infrastructure component of our digital landscape vision.,Pro-CBDC
that is why i would call for a ceiling of the individual cbdc holdings.,Wait-and-See
"let me be clear, cbdc is not about the big brother of central banks threatening the free world of decentralized finance.",Pro-CBDC
"and more broadly, it also a satisfaction to see that more and more central banks, notably some from asia, show an interest for wholesale cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
the landscape in 2030: cbdcs or private digital payment solutions?,Wait-and-See
now i know full well that philosophers from antiquity cannot provide us with any immediate input on cbdc (central bank digital currency).,Wait-and-See
the aim is to investigate whether we should introduce a digital euro and what it might look like.,Wait-and-See
"if you asked the average consumer on the street, the majority would probably not see an immediate need for something called the ""digital euro"".",Anti-CBDC
"some also take the view that a digital euro is not needed because other innovative means of payment like stablecoins, already exist.",Anti-CBDC
quite the opposite: both could be integral and important parts of a sound future ecosystem in payments: the digital euro would be offered alongside private payment solutions.,Pro-CBDC
"3 cbdc (central bank digital currency) a new offering in often welloccupied markets as we have learnt: up to now, a cbdc (central bank digital currency) is uncharted territory for the vast majority of central banks and also for the relevant legislators.",Wait-and-See
(ii) it is expected that cbdc (central bank digital currency) will receive the status of legal tender and thus be accepted nearly everywhere.,Pro-CBDC
"because paying digitally based on private solutions is already a well-functioning daily experience for chinese people, encouraging them to change their behaviour and adopt cbdc (central bank digital currency) seems quite a burden.",Anti-CBDC
"for this reason, the people's bank of china (pboc) distributed an amount of cbdc (central bank digital currency) for free to nudge payers to adopt it.",Pro-CBDC
"for sure, there might be certain features of cbdc (central bank digital currency) which could be considered unique from a user perspective, like offline capability or a specific focus on privacy.",Pro-CBDC
"4 conclusion ladies and gentlemen, looking ahead to the year 2030, the question of cbdc (central bank digital currency) or private payment solutions is, in my view, not a binary one.",Pro-CBDC
"regarding cbdc (central bank digital currency) payment solutions, i think both parties should make the most of their capabilities: central banks offering resilient and secure infrastructures, and taking care of financial stability, efficiency and innovation; and private actors leveraging their experience of end-user-focused interfaces.",Pro-CBDC
and that is still very true for our work on cbdc (central bank digital currency).,Pro-CBDC
the digital euro is a key innovation for serving the interests of europeans in a digital world.,Pro-CBDC
the fifth focus area is more exploratory and covers emerging payment infrastructures and arrangements including central bank digital currencies (cbdcs).,Wait-and-See
"in addition, through cbdc, it will be possible to ""enjoy"" the advantages of a digital currency, while reducing the risk inherent in it.",Pro-CBDC
"for example, cbdc will be able to serve as a gateway to the worlds of defi in place of the private stablecoins.",Pro-CBDC
cbdc could also allow faster and more efficient cross-border payments.,Pro-CBDC
"to the extent that there will be interoperability between cbdc systems of various countries, cross-border payments could become inexpensive, efficient, and faster.",Pro-CBDC
the debenture token market benefitted from having a riskless settlement asset in the form of a wholesale central bank digital currency (wcbdc) used for settlement.,Pro-CBDC

i. a 'retail' cbdc for a renewed intermediation in the digital age let me suggest three hopefully shared principles to climb together this face of the mountain.,Pro-CBDC
"neither one is better than the other, but in a joint venture each partner needs the other: a digital euro should never mean disappearance of commercial bank money; conversely, digitalisation cannot mean the disappearance of central bank money.",Pro-CBDC
"2. even if the precise use cases are not yet definitively fixed, there are several material reasons to consider the issuance of a digital euro the main rationale for a digital euro is therefore to preserve the role of public money in a digital economy.",Pro-CBDC
we just decided to set up a cbdc working group within our french payments committee (the cnps).,Pro-CBDC
"concerns have emerged that the issuance of a cbdc would threaten the role of banking intermediaries in client relationships, while draining banks' deposits through a massive conversion into risk-free cbdc accounts, especially in times of stress.",Anti-CBDC
"in particular, i believe that the eurosystem should not have the role of managing digital euro holdings: the banque de france closed its last private customer accounts over 20 years ago, and does not intend to reopen any.",Wait-and-See
"we central banks have been very proactive here, as demonstrated by the ""wholesale cbdc focus"" of the bis innovation hubs.",Pro-CBDC
"a wholesale cbdc could be used for the settlement of such securities issued on dlt, which is essential to prevent market and liquidity fragmentation.",Pro-CBDC

"first, the opportunities and risks presented by the digital euro.",Wait-and-See
"and third, i will report on the current status of the digital euro project.",Wait-and-See
the idea is to make a cbdc (central bank digital currency) available to individuals and businesses: like euro banknotes but in digital form.,Pro-CBDC
"if, at the end of the project, a decision should be taken to introduce a digital euro, a further component would be added to our monetary system.",Pro-CBDC
"depending on the design of the digital euro, however, i believe that these risks can be managed.",Pro-CBDC
"if commercial banks lose a significant portion of these deposits because citizens are using the digital euro as a store of value, banks' credit supply could fall and financing conditions for the real economy could deteriorate.",Anti-CBDC
"however, the fact that i began by looking at the risks does not mean that they should shape our perception of the digital euro.",Pro-CBDC
"if there were a digital euro, private commercial bank money could also be exchanged for central bank money within the digital world.",Pro-CBDC
"this way, central bank digital currency could be an important building block for public money to continue to act as an anchor for all forms of money denominated in euro, even in an increasingly digitalised economy.",Pro-CBDC
one could imagine such a wallet also containing a digital euro in the future.,Pro-CBDC
"cbdc (central bank digital currency) now opens up the possibility of designing settlement systems for payment transactions in such a way that cross-border payments can be processed more cheaply, faster and more efficiently than with current payment systems.",Pro-CBDC
"so when we talk about the interoperability of cbdc (central bank digital currency), we are looking at a medium-term goal.",Pro-CBDC
"but this opportunity should be taken nonetheless, because central bank digital currency is not just a means of payment - it also requires a new settlement infrastructure.",Pro-CBDC
"if a foreign central bank digital currency became widespread domestically, this could impair the effectiveness of monetary policy.",Anti-CBDC
"cbdc (central bank digital currency) could also offer a currency exchange solution by making processes automated, simplified and more transparent.",Pro-CBDC
"as i see it, we should exploit the opportunities presented by cbdc (central bank digital currency).",Pro-CBDC
"should it come to fruition, a digital euro is intended to enable simple payments in everyday life - just like we're familiar with when we use cash, but in digital form.",Pro-CBDC
we are therefore considering measures at this early stage to prevent an excessive and abrupt shift of deposits from commercial banks into the digital euro.,Wait-and-See
"by contrast, a tiered remuneration system would provide more flexibility to meet the demand for digital euro.",Pro-CBDC
this could be achieved by automatically channelling surplus digital euro balances into a commercial bank account.,Pro-CBDC
what the specific use of such instruments might look like and what the specific upper limits or threshold values would be can only be determined for good shortly before the potential introduction of a digital euro.,Wait-and-See
"first of all, it has to be established what form the overall package preparing us for a digital euro might take.",Wait-and-See
our assessment of these benefits has not changed even as we consider whether a central bank digital currency (cbdc) might fit into the future u.s. money and payments landscape.,Pro-CBDC
"some have joked that a central bank digital currency (cbdc) is ""a solution looking for a problem"".",Anti-CBDC
"while i may not be an outright fan of cbdcs, i think the detractors unfairly downplay the potential merits.",Pro-CBDC
let me next turn to central bank digital currencies.,Wait-and-See
"the investigation phase started in late 2021 and is expected to be concluded in october 2023. once the investigation phase is completed, we will decide whether to embark on actually building a digital euro.",Wait-and-See

"mas sees good potential for wholesale cbdcs, especially for cross-border payments and settlements.",Pro-CBDC
"this means that holders of cbdcs will have a direct claim on the central bank that has issued them, similar to how physical currency works today.",Pro-CBDC
"wholesale cbdcs on a distributed ledger have the potential to achieve atomic settlement, or the exchange of two linked assets in real-time.",Pro-CBDC
mas does not see a compelling case for retail cbdcs in singapore.,Anti-CBDC
"the case for a retail cbdc in singapore is not compelling for now, given wellfunctioning payment systems and broad financial inclusion.",Anti-CBDC
"in fact, one of the reasons why we, at the eurosystem, are looking into cbdcs in depth is to evaluate their potential to ensure easy access to central bank money in the digital age as a foundation of our currency.",Pro-CBDC
"that said, the biggest source of concern is how a non-controlled expansion of the digital euro as a form of investment could, indeed, threaten the ability of authorities to properly maintain financial stability.",Anti-CBDC
"as a matter of fact, a too attractive and accessible digital euro could foster a significant migration of banks deposits, thus compromising their intermediation and lending capacity plus also likely destabilizing the entire banking system in times of financial stress.",Anti-CBDC
"to prevent these macroeconomic consequences from happening, ongoing discussions are currently focusing on what potential safeguards could be built into the digital euro, yet final decisions remain pretty much open at this stage.",Wait-and-See
i believe the recent advance of it technology and the growing interest in improving cross-border payment systems and developing cbdcs provide another great opportunity for us to redouble our efforts.,Pro-CBDC
2 what could a digital euro deliver?,Wait-and-See
3 when will a decision on the digital euro be made?,Wait-and-See
"so let me start by talking today about ""why"" a digital euro might be useful.",Pro-CBDC
1 why do we need a digital euro?,Wait-and-See
"this is because cbdc (central bank digital currency) would be as stable in value as other forms of central bank money, i.e.",Pro-CBDC
"ultimately, it is also a question of setting standards and potentially of establishing multilateral platforms that can also be used by other countries for their cbdc (central bank digital currency).",Pro-CBDC
"this brings us to the question of ""what"" a digital euro could deliver.",Wait-and-See
"more than 340 million people would be able to use cbdc (central bank digital currency) to pay anywhere in the single euro payments area (sepa (single euro payments area)), across borders and independently of international providers.",Pro-CBDC
"for example, a digital euro could lead to outflows of deposits from the banking sector and encourage short-term shifts during times of financial stress.",Anti-CBDC
"but with the aim of avoiding international fragmentation, we have to pay special attention and dedicate sufficient efforts then to cross-border interoperability, and hence to wholesale cbdc as a way to ensure it.",Pro-CBDC
today i would like to demystify this concept of wholesale cbdc.,Wait-and-See
i will first clarify what wholesale cbdc is and what it is not.,Wait-and-See
this misconception is fuelled by the commonly held assumption that wholesale cbdc needs to be operated using dlt.,Wait-and-See
"but wholesale cbdc is not synonymous with dlt, as it can be based on any digital technology.",Wait-and-See
the aim of retail cbdcs is to create a digital form of central bank money that can be used by everyone.,Pro-CBDC
"wholesale cbdc projects are about making digital interbank transactions, such as securities settlement and cross-currency payments, safer and more efficient.",Pro-CBDC
this is because retail cbdc is new.,Wait-and-See
modernising wholesale cbdc i would therefore like to focus on our continuous efforts to improve wholesale payment systems.,Pro-CBDC
"our cbdc experiments, on which i will elaborate in a few minutes, also led us to develop our own permissioned blockchain (called dl3s- distributed ledger for securities settlement system) in collaboration with an it provider.",Pro-CBDC
the question that now attracts public attention is whether central banks' investigation phases will lead to the development of cbdcs.,Wait-and-See
almost all of that attention is focused on retail cbdcs.,Wait-and-See
"beyond purely technical considerations, a retail cbdc could play an anchor role in the digital world, similar to the role played by banknotes in the physical world,iv and hence preserve the accessibility and usability of central bank money.",Pro-CBDC
"on the other side of a mountain, you will obviously always find a side that is less exposed to the sun; here, this northern face is wholesale cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"first, a wholesale cbdc could significantly contribute to improving cross-border and cross-currency payments, a topic on which we have made progress over the past year.",Pro-CBDC
"second, a wholesale cbdc could accompany the tokenisation of securities as a safe and liquid settlement asset for them on a blockchain technology.",Pro-CBDC
"failing to offer market participants a wholesale cbdc could open the door to an extensive use of so- called stablecoins, which would pose a systemic risk.",Pro-CBDC
"over the past two years, the banque de france has therefore been looking into a wholesale cbdc with a view to contribute to eurosystem's efforts in designing and developing it when the time comes.",Pro-CBDC
"and house of lords, central bank digital currencies: a solution in search of a problem?",Anti-CBDC
"a wholesale cbdc directly integrated on dlt could be used to settle tokenised assets, o bringing the security of central bank money.",Pro-CBDC
"in addition, a wholesale cbdc has the potential to improve cross-border payments.",Pro-CBDC
this is the goal that banque de france has been pursuing since the launch of its first experiments on wholesale cbdc in 2020. we are now taking this endeavour a step further with a second round of experiments.,Pro-CBDC
"dear colleagues, central banks must embrace the revolution underway in digital money to ensure that they remain at the heart of the global payments system.",Pro-CBDC
"we will review the overall design of a possible digital euro next year, once all choices have been made.",Wait-and-See
it also has no bearing on whether or not we ultimately decide to issue a digital euro.,Wait-and-See
"i will do so in parallel to your legislative discussions about a regulation to establish the digital euro, which the european commission plans to propose in the first quarter of next year.7 today i would like to discuss two topics with you.",Wait-and-See
"we have not yet taken a decision about which technology would be best suited for a digital euro but, when we do, we will consider efficiency, safety and integration with customer-facing services, as well as the environmental impact.",Wait-and-See
we expect to publish our results in the first quarter of next year.12 intermediaries would also have a role to play in the funding and defunding of users' 13 holdings in digital euro.,Wait-and-See
"conversely, they could convert digital euro into cash or move money from their digital euro account to their bank account.",Wait-and-See
this should be the case irrespective of the entity with which they open their digital euro account or wallet and the country they are from.,Wait-and-See
there are no plans to reuse these prototypes in the subsequent phases of the digital euro project.,Wait-and-See
"13 users will have the option to choose whether the conversion of commercial bank money or cash into digital euro, and vice versa, should take place manually or automatically.",Wait-and-See
"for the automatic option, we are investigating a waterfall functionality that would allow users to make or receive payments in digital euro above the holding limit by linking a digital euro account to a commercial bank account.",Wait-and-See
and that's the very reason why i'm an advocate of the eurosystem taking a proactive approach in addressing the changing shape of money and pushing forward with its investigations into central bank digital currency.,Pro-CBDC
central bank digital currency and the associated infrastructure would be an important complement to the existing set of ways to pay.,Pro-CBDC
the introduction of central bank digital currency poses a major challenge from a technical and economic perspective.,Wait-and-See
"one, link up faster payment systems two, build a multi-cbdc common platform three, expand private sector blockchain-based payment networks first, link up faster payment systems.",Pro-CBDC
this is where the second solution comes in: a multi-cbdc common platform.,Pro-CBDC
"wholesale cbdcs, which are direct liabilities of central banks, are well suited to be used on such a distributed ledger to support simultaneous settlement, or the exchange of two linked assets in real-time.",Pro-CBDC
"they do this by exchanging directly with one another the cbdcs they have been issued, thereby reducing settlement time and cost.",Pro-CBDC
project jura in the swiss centre is exploring the direct transfer of euro and swiss franc wholesale cbdcs between french and swiss commercial banks on a single distributed ledger platform operated by a third party.,Pro-CBDC
project dunbar is also focused on addressing the governance issues related to operating a multi-cbdc platform.,Pro-CBDC
the use of distributed ledgers for cross-border settlement need not be confined to cbdcs.,Wait-and-See
"to date, no decisions have been made by the board on whether to move forward with a cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"but one area where economics, cbdcs, and national security dovetail is the role of the dollar.",Wait-and-See
"advocates for creating a u.s. cbdc often assert how it is important to the long-term status of the dollar, particularly if other major jurisdictions adopt a cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
"as i will discuss, the underlying reasons for why the dollar is the dominant currency have little to do with technology, and i believe the introduction of a cbdc would not affect those underlying reasons.",Anti-CBDC
"my focus today is on just one supposed threat-namely, the purported shifting payments landscape as a result of the growth of digital assets, particularly cbdcs.",Wait-and-See
what would be the effect of cbdcs and other digital money-like instruments on the role of the dollar?,Wait-and-See
"second, would a u.s. cbdc affect them?",Wait-and-See
"foreign cbdcs first, i will consider the emergence of one or more foreign cbdcs in a world with no u. s. cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"that is, advocates for a cbdc tend to promote the potential for a cbdc to reduce payment frictions by lowering transaction costs, enabling faster settlement speeds, and providing a better user experience.",Pro-CBDC
"i am highly skeptical that a cbdc on its own could sufficiently reduce the traditional payment frictions to prevent things like fraud, theft, money laundering, or the financing of 12 terrorism.",Anti-CBDC
"no other country is fully comparable with the united states on those fronts, and a cbdc would not change that.",Anti-CBDC
"since digital currencies would make it easier for a government to monitor transactions, shifting to a cbdc might make a company less willing to use that country's currency.",Anti-CBDC
"for example, i suspect that many companies will remain wary of china's cbdc for just this reason.",Anti-CBDC
u.s. cbdc i am also skeptical that a u.s. cbdc would affect this hypothetical foreign company's decisionmaking.,Anti-CBDC
a u.s. cbdc is unlikely to dramatically reshape the liquidity or depth of u.s. capital markets.,Anti-CBDC
"as i have said before, the introduction of a u.s. cbdc would come with a number of costs and risks, including cyber risk and the threat of disintermediating commercial banks, both of which could harm, rather than help, the u.s. dollar's standing internationally.",Anti-CBDC
"for the non-u.s. company already conducting its business in dollars, introducing a u.s. cbdc would not provide material benefits over and above the current reasons for making u.s. dollar-denominated payments.",Anti-CBDC
"for non-u.s. companies conducting their business in currencies other than dollars, a u.s. cbdc similarly would likely not be preferred to their current options.",Anti-CBDC
"it could be that individuals outside the united states would find a u.s. cbdc particularly attractive, but, again, making a u.s. cbdc globally available would raise a number of issues, including money laundering and international financial stability concerns.",Anti-CBDC
"we should instead focus and debate the salient cbdc-related topics, like its effects on financial stability, payment system improvements, and financial inclusion.",Wait-and-See
"3 see christopher j. waller (2021), ""cbdc: a solution in search of a problem?""",Anti-CBDC
"i would like to mention two key concepts here: updating existing payment systems, for example via instant payments, and central bank digital currency (cbdc), specifically the project on a digital euro.",Wait-and-See

"by the end of the investigation phase in autumn 2023, the eurosystem will decide whether to launch a realisation phase on a digital euro.",Wait-and-See
the introduction of a digital euro could follow in autumn 2026.,Wait-and-See
no conversation about payments innovation is complete without mention of central bank digital currencies (cbdc).,Wait-and-See
"the federal reserve has not made any decisions about whether to issue a cbdc, and if we believe it makes sense to do so, we would want the support of congress and the administration.",Wait-and-See
"in the meantime, we're doing the work of understanding the technological requirements of such a system, deepening our understanding of potential policy tradeoffs, and taking a look at how other countries are thinking about and experimenting with cbdcs.",Wait-and-See
"however, we recognise the benefits of discussing various issues at the international level, such as cross-currency payments made in retail central bank digital currency (cbdc) and the potential effects of giving foreign users access to domestic retail cbdc under specific conditions.",Pro-CBDC
"their widescale use within europe would therefore pose a dual challenge, for our strategic autonomy and for our monetary stability; indeed this is one of the reasons why the eurosystem has launched an investigation phase on a retail digital euro.",Anti-CBDC
this is the objective of our experiments on a wholesale cbdc.,Pro-CBDC
"we are also participating actively in the eurosystem's work on a potential retail cbdc , also called the ""digital euro"", which would be used by the general public in everyday payments.",Pro-CBDC
"one strong focus here is on the importance of digital forms of money, up to and including central bank digital currency.",Pro-CBDC
and this has led interest in central bank digital currencies (cbdcs) to grow considerably.,Wait-and-See
cbdcs could promote financial inclusion by serving as a gateway to wider access to financial services.,Pro-CBDC
this explains why cbdcs are issued first in emerging market economies.,Wait-and-See
"rather, a top policy goal of our cbdc research is to prepare for changes in the payments landscape driven by digital transformation and the growing presence of big techs in financial services.",Pro-CBDC
"in particular, the bank of korea has recently completed its first experiment which lasted for ten months on a retail cbdc based on distributed ledger technology (dlt).",Wait-and-See
"since we don't have any urgent need to introduce a referred to as a cbdc, we thought it would be better to test such a disruptive technology.",Wait-and-See
"in addition, with there being no solid use case for cbdcs yet, we cannot give incentives such as bonus rewards that credit cards or other private payment service providers offer to customers.",Anti-CBDC
"therefore, for the success of a retail cbdc we need to ramp up our efforts for convenience, versatility, and incentives from the end-user's perspective.",Pro-CBDC
"and more importantly, we need to make people understand that building technological infrastructure for a retail cbdc is necessary to prepare for future changes such as the rise of the metaverse.",Pro-CBDC
"third, it may never be too early to establish effective private-public partnerships for cbdcs.",Pro-CBDC
there is a consensus that collaboration with the private sector is prerequisite to the success of a cbdc.,Pro-CBDC
"these private participants have to carry out a lot of tasks including provision of customer services and compliance with regulations like the know your customer (kyc) rule, and transaction approvals under a dlt model, even if the cbdc business model is not clear.",Wait-and-See
"lastly, further exploration of wholesale cbdcs is essential.",Pro-CBDC
"the bank of korea will step up its cbdc-related efforts going forward, but no final decision has been made as to whether to issue a cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"i think it is still a good idea to proceed cautiously, even in deciding the design and operation, not to mention the actual introduction of a cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"in this regard, further international cooperation is required to set global standards and ensure interoperability of cbdcs.",Pro-CBDC
"it is also necessary to conduct more extensive studies on potential risks caused by a cbdc such as disintermediation and digital runs, and impacts on the transmission channels of monetary policy.",Wait-and-See
"in closing, another reason i have taken interest in cbdc personally is that i think cbdc could serve as a golden opportunity to strengthen regional financial cooperation.",Pro-CBDC
"cbdcs could contribute to integrating global and asian financial markets and act as a catalyst in developing regional capital markets, by improving efficiency in cross-border payments.",Pro-CBDC
cbdc has attracted growing attention in recent years.,Wait-and-See
the research on cbdc can help efficiently satisfy the public's demand for fiat money in the context of digital economy.,Pro-CBDC

"the digital euro project is now in the investigation phase, which started just one year ago and is intended to end in september 2023. then, if so decided by the governing council, the realization phase would begin, which would last another three years.",Wait-and-See
even if important milestones have been reached so far this has no bearing on whether or not will be decided by the ecb decision bodies to move to the realization phase or to issue a digital euro.,Wait-and-See
"we have reached by now important milestones, however this has no bearing on whether or not the ecb decision bodies will decide to move to the realization phase or to issue a digital euro.",Wait-and-See
"moreover, many large economies could issue cbdcs with benefits in terms of efficiency, scalability, liquidity and safety that would support their attractiveness internationally.",Pro-CBDC
"in such a context, for a large economy, as in the case of the euro area, not issuing a cbdc could undermine the international role of the currency itself, thus creating additional risks to sovereignty.",Pro-CBDC
we must be vigilant and we have to understand and preside all potential risks of issuing a digital euro.,Wait-and-See
"in this way, users will not need to transfer large amounts of their liquid savings from bank deposits to digital euros in order to use the cbdc for their daily activities.",Pro-CBDC
"moreover, the adoption of a digital euro depends on how easily its users will be able to include this new form of central bank money in their payment habits.",Pro-CBDC
"this means that the payment service directive, the payment account directive and the e.money directive need to be analysed in order to verify if and how they may encompass a digital euro.",Wait-and-See
"balancing functional requirements requires solving complex problems which might be not self-evident at first sight: an example is the trade-off between the privacy-preserving characteristics of a cbdc with the need for auditability, arising from anti-money laundering and contrast to financing of terrorism requirements.",Wait-and-See
"given what has been discussed so far, cbdcs could bring wide benefits, but the ultimate consequences for the well-being of individuals in society depend on how central banks will address the associated challenges.",Wait-and-See
the issuance of a cbdc would be critical to preside the risks i have already mentioned especially in preserving the role of central bank money as a safe asset at the heart of the system.,Pro-CBDC
"in addition, i want to mention two other opportunities of issuing a cbdc, as for the financial inclusion and the cross-border payments.",Pro-CBDC
"furthermore, a cbdc has the potential to offer improved security as it would rely on some form of identification to initiate payments, making it harder for fraudsters and thieves to carry out illegal activities.",Pro-CBDC
contribute to the improvement of cross-border payments cbdcs could open the way for innovations that improve international payments.,Pro-CBDC
"a cbdc could therefore be a benefit as it could improve an efficient and competitive payments market, reducing the possibility for a private company to create a dominant position.",Pro-CBDC
a wholesale cbdc service based on dlt (i.e.,Pro-CBDC
"a tokenized cbdc) could possibly be developed down the road, if market developments so require2.",Pro-CBDC
"we are also one of the few central banking institutions researching and piloting both wholesale and retail central bank digital currency, or cbdcs.",Pro-CBDC
the platform now has the exibility to allow central banks to easily connect through cbdcs or traditional payment systems.,Pro-CBDC
"10. further, as you are aware, the rbi is currently working towards a phased implementation of the digital rupee (e).",Pro-CBDC
"yesterday (1st november, 2022), we have started our pilot project on wholesale cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
we propose to commence the pilot project for retail cbdcs shortly.,Pro-CBDC
"while at present the federal reserve has neither issued a cbdc nor plans to do so imminently, ongoing research improves our understanding of the risks and opportunities inherent to a cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"additionally, one of the most important aspects in our deliberations is that any form of a cbdc in the future would need to be intermediated.",Wait-and-See
"while the federal reserve has made no decision on whether or how to issue a cbdc, we are actively conducting technical investigations into both retail and wholesale cbdc design.",Wait-and-See
"in the use case they explored, the hamilton team was able to demonstrate the potential for usage at scale, which would 6 be a key design element of a retail cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
"as a complement, and in line with the new york fed's unique role in the federal reserve system with wholesale payments in both domestic payments and foreign exchange, the new york innovation center is researching technical aspects related to wholesale cbdcs.",Pro-CBDC
"project dunbar - a partnership among the bis innovation hub, reserve bank of australia, bank negara malaysia, south africa reserve bank, and mas - has built open-source distributed ledger platforms for international settlements using wholesale central bank digital currencies, or cbdcs.",Pro-CBDC
"mas will be launching project ubin+, a global initiative on the cross-border exchange and settlement of foreign currency transactions using wholesale cbdcs.",Pro-CBDC
mas is working with the central banks of france and switzerland and the bis innovation hub to explore the exchange and settlement of wholesale cbdcs with an automated market maker .,Pro-CBDC
"cbdcs, as direct liabilities of the central bank, marry the advantages of central bank issued cash with the advantages of the blockchain.",Pro-CBDC
"if i can summarise, mas is essentially: discouraging retail investment in cryptocurrencies; facilitating stablecoins through sound regulation; allowing tokenised bank deposits; and experimenting with cbdcs.",Pro-CBDC
"just as the heat of fire reshapes objects into new forms, we want to reshape money through our experiments with tokenised deposits and cbdcs.",Pro-CBDC
"our work on cbdc so far has already attracted a lot of interest from fintechs, financial institutions and the general public alike.",Pro-CBDC
many of these were from concerned individuals fearing the imminent removal of cash and assertion of state control through a cbdc.,Anti-CBDC
the key insight from this consultation was the need for any potential cbdc to be privacy centric.,Wait-and-See
"we have set up a standing external group to facilitate this, and are consulting with industry stakeholders on technical aspects of cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"it is not a race, but as a matter of fact the euro area is at a relatively advanced stage in exploring a central bank digital currency (cbdc).",Pro-CBDC
"so it is clear that if we want the digital euro to be attractive, it needs to be designed in a way that meets people's privacy expectations.",Wait-and-See
so let me begin by outlining why we are exploring a digital euro.,Pro-CBDC
"after that, i will present the potential core features a digital euro might have, before updating you on the current project status.",Wait-and-See
2 why are we considering issuing a digital euro?,Wait-and-See
why are we considering issuing a digital euro?,Wait-and-See
"cbdc would ensure that all citizens have free access to a simple, universally accepted, secure and reliable means of payment.",Pro-CBDC
4 what is the current status of the digital euro project?,Wait-and-See
it is clear that a digital euro would have to ensure a high degree of privacy while complying with the applicable regulations.,Wait-and-See
"by the end of the investigation phase in autumn 2023, the ecb's governing council will decide, in close consultation with the legislative bodies of the european union, whether to launch a realisation phase on a digital euro, which would take another three years.",Wait-and-See
"if everything goes to plan, the first users could pay with digital euro in autumn 2026. some critics argue that this timeframe is not ambitious enough.",Wait-and-See
i think we are going about things the right way by not rushing our analysis and our decision on whether or not to introduce a digital euro.,Wait-and-See
the eurosystem experience in developing and providing a digital euro one of the additional measures that could be adopted to respond to the challenges raised by financial innovation is the development of a retail central bank digital currency (cbdc).,Pro-CBDC
"in fact, a cbdc's potential contribution to boosting the strategic autonomy of the european union, by offering a fast and efficient alternative to other payment providers, is one of the key reasons why the eurosystem is assessing the issuance of a digital euro.",Pro-CBDC
it would probably be short-sighted to think that a cbdc would have no impact on the financial system.,Wait-and-See
"rather, a more flexible approach has been agreed, ensuring that the design of the digital euro includes a wide set of tools, while leaving the decision on which ones to actually implement to a later stage.",Wait-and-See
"then, the governing council will decide whether to move into the implementation phase, in which technical solutions and business arrangements for a digital euro would actually be developed and tested with a view to their potential launch.",Wait-and-See
"the world is keeping its pace and advancing toward central bank digital currencies, internationally integrated faster payment channels, growing fintechs, open banking, and cloud technology.",Pro-CBDC
but central banks are responding by advancing the development of central bank digital currencies.,Pro-CBDC
careful design of cbdcs and their distribution models will address disintermediation concerns.,Pro-CBDC
central bank digital currencies would instead preserve the use of public money for digital retail payments.,Pro-CBDC
"by offering a digital, risk-free common denominator, a central bank digital currency would facilitate convertibility among different forms of private digital money.",Pro-CBDC
"as part of this effort, we have embarked on a project with the digital finance cooperative research centre involving the issuance of a pilot cbdc that has real value, circulating in a ring-fenced environment.",Pro-CBDC
"and in connection with payments, we are compiling the views of various agents and government agencies on the issuance of digital currencies by central banks, a work that will be released early in 2023. this year also saw the beginning of our financial policy meetings.",Wait-and-See
"16. to provide a more efficient alternative to private cryptocurrencies, rbi has embarked on the journey to introduce cbdc (digital rupee).",Pro-CBDC
"among the various benefits of cbdc, perhaps the most important is its potential to make cross-border payments faster and cheaper.",Pro-CBDC
"it has also spurred a concerted effort by central banks to harness these new technologies, through cbdcs and other initiatives, in order to ensure that central bank money remains fit-forpurpose in a digitalized monetary system.",Pro-CBDC
"last january, the fed published a paper soliciting comment on possible forms and uses of a cbdc in the united states.",Wait-and-See
"the fed continues to study the idea, although much of what supporters hope to achieve with a central bank digital currency may be provided through fednow and existing private payment services.",Anti-CBDC
"20 second, the eurosystem is considering a new digital euro app[ ], which would include only basic payment functionalities performed by intermediaries.",Pro-CBDC
"[ together with the european commission, we are still analysing a possible compensation model for the digital euro.",Wait-and-See
"during this phase we would develop and test the technical solutions and business arrangements necessary to eventually provide and distribute a digital euro, if and when decided.",Wait-and-See
the possible decision by the governing council to issue a digital euro would be taken at a later stage and only after the parliament and the council of the eu have adopted the legislative act.,Wait-and-See
the digital euro project is a truly european initiative.,Pro-CBDC
the scope of digital euro basic services is yet to be defined but should be similar in nature to the basic services that credit institutions are to provide under the payment accounts directive (pad).,Wait-and-See
"see, for instance, the feedback provided by consumer associations on the 4th erpb technical session on digital euro.",Wait-and-See
"technically, such integrated settlement would be possible with both private token money and cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"the second model involves integrated settlement, using a swiss franc wholesale cbdc (cf.",Pro-CBDC
"at this point, let us make it clear that this work is not intended as a declaration of the snb's intent to issue wholesale cbdc, or indeed to offer another settlement model.",Wait-and-See
"meanwhile, a lot of work is going on to assess the future of digital money, including central bank digital currency (cbdc).",Wait-and-See
it requires banks to be more active in thinking about digital commercial bank money and not leave it to cbdc.,Wait-and-See
no decision has been taken to implement the digital pound but the bank and treasury's assessment is that it is likely to be needed if current trends in payments and money - some of which i have been discussing - continue.,Pro-CBDC
there is agreement that cbdc should eventually contribute to improving cross-border payments.,Pro-CBDC
"as global work on cbdc accelerates, international cooperation in this field will become even more important.",Pro-CBDC
this variability complicates any discussion of a cbdc simply because we may not be talking about the same thing.,Wait-and-See
what problem could a cbdc solve?,Wait-and-See
"see bank of england and hm treasury, the digital pound: a new form of money for households and businesses?",Wait-and-See
"similarly, a government-appointed report in sweden did not find a current need for a cbdc, though the riksbank - 3 - improving the speed of payments, particularly retail payments, can be accomplished without the introduction of a cbdc.",Anti-CBDC
"see centralbanking.com, ""sweden does not yet need cbdc, inquiry finds,"" web article, https://www.centralbanking.com/fintech/cbdc/7957236/sweden-does-not-yet-need-cbdc-inquiry-finds and sveriges riksbank, e-krona pilot phase 3 (sweden: riksbank, april 2023), https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/payments-cash/e-krona/e-krona-reports/e-krona-pilot-phase-3/.",Wait-and-See
enabling this type of - 5 - limit through a cbdc would stand in stark contrast to the flexibility and freedom embedded in physical currency or bank deposits and could serve to control or even harm consumers and businesses.,Anti-CBDC
"the efficiency and speed of the payments system cbdcs are often discussed in the context of providing fast or instant payments for a variety of transactions, whether consumer-to-business or person-to-person transactions.",Pro-CBDC
"similar to the questions noted for a retail level cbdc, policymakers must carefully consider the wholesale use cases, including whether there is - 6 - added value of a wholesale version of cbdc in supporting new infrastructure to financial transactions over and above existing methods.",Wait-and-See
"a cbdc, or lack of it, may not meaningfully change the existing incentives for people, firms, or countries to conduct business in the dollar.",Anti-CBDC
"regardless, it is important for us to continue to evaluate the evolving landscape of digital assets and understand whether and how well-regulated stablecoins or a cbdc would interact with each other and with the broader payments system.",Wait-and-See
"in such an intermediated model, banks and other eligible institutions would build technology on top of a cbdc that could be offered to retail consumers and others to provide products and services that may not be available today.",Pro-CBDC
unintended effects on the u.s. banking system it is also necessary to consider the potential impacts of a cbdc on the banking sector.,Wait-and-See
there are significant risks in adopting a cbdc that cannibalizes rather than complements the u.s. banking system.,Anti-CBDC
it seems likely that such a cbdc would reduce the funds available to lend and increase the cost of capital across the economy.,Anti-CBDC
it would be irresponsible to undermine the traditional banking system by introducing a cbdc without appropriate guardrails to mitigate these potential impacts on the banking sector and the financial system.,Anti-CBDC
"from my perspective, there could be some promise for wholesale cbdcs in the future for settlement of certain financial market transactions and processing international payments.",Pro-CBDC
"we have also started the conduct of a pilot wholesale cbdc or central bank digital currency, a major capacity-building activity for both the bsp and the financial industry.",Pro-CBDC
"by the way, we say, ""we will not go into retail cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"we will be in wholesale cbdc which, hopefully, will also facilitate cross-border transfers.""",Pro-CBDC
the taskforce's conclusion is that we are not yet at a point where a firm decision can be made to implement a digital pound.,Wait-and-See
this stage will take around two to three years following which a decision will be made whether or not to proceed to the next stage and implement a digital pound in the uk.,Wait-and-See
"it is of course possible that some of the technologies developed in the crypto world might be useful in the development of a digital pound, but as i will explain later, there is a large range of technologies that are now under consideration.",Wait-and-See
"our assessment is that future developments in payments and money will make it likely that, alongside regulation, we will in future need a digital pound, issued by the bank of england to perform this anchor function.",Pro-CBDC
"however, the taskforce concluded, that we are not at present at a point at which a firm decision could be taken to implement the digital pound.",Wait-and-See
the work will not delay but rather shorten the lead time to actual launch should a firm decision be taken in the future to implement the digital pound so that a digital pound could be introduced in the second half of the decade.,Wait-and-See
"we cannot, of course, know ex ante, how households and businesses would respond to a digital pound and how much they would want to hold.",Wait-and-See
interoperability between national and regional central bank digital currencies could bring substantial benefits by reducing the cost and frictions in cross border payments.,Pro-CBDC
we have made no decision yet on whether a digital pound would use dlt.,Wait-and-See
this assumption is particularly cautious for higher interest rate environments when deposits would be expected to pay holders somewhat more interest than an (unremunerated) digital pound.,Wait-and-See
"if a cbdc is needed and decided as a matter of public interest, don't oppose it.",Pro-CBDC
"in the eurosystem, we are currently considering making central bank digital currency available to individuals and enterprises.",Pro-CBDC
no decision has been made about the digital euro thus far.,Wait-and-See
inclusion is also a key principle behind our design work on a central bank digital currency.,Pro-CBDC
"this research has been critical to inform cash and central bank digital currency, cbdc, policy development, and better understand the opportunities and challenges of a cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
"supplementing this with dlt based wholesale cbdc may at some point become necessary or desirable, for example if dlt and blockchain based technology becomes pervasive in economic networks and platforms.",Pro-CBDC
"in this context, cbdc holds significant promise.",Pro-CBDC
"with india already piloting its cbdc, it is well poised to steer the discussion on the need for cross-border interoperability of cbdcs and developing standards for effective interfacing, so as to realise the potential of cheaper, efficient and faster crossborder payments.",Pro-CBDC
8. the introduction of a central bank digital currency could have implications for the size of the balance sheet.,Wait-and-See
"from the viewpoint of preparing thoroughly for the future, the bank of japan, two years ago, began its technical experiments for retail cbdc assuming a wide range of users including individuals and firms.",Pro-CBDC
"basically, we are building an automated market for the exchange of cbdcs based on a concept imported from defi.",Pro-CBDC
"[ a requirement for merchants to accept digital euro could, in fact, also be seen as an opportunity.",Pro-CBDC
"it will then be european legislators to decide whether the digital euro will be an inclusive, truly european means of payment - widely usable and accessible across the entire euro area, free for basic use, and offering the highest levels of privacy.",Pro-CBDC
"throughout the next project phase, which is expected to be launched later this year, we will accommodate necessary adjustments to the design of the digital euro that may emerge from legislative deliberations.",Wait-and-See
the possible decision by the governing council to issue a digital euro would be taken only after the legislative act has been adopted.,Wait-and-See
it will be a decisive step forward for the digital euro and put europe at the forefront of the work on central bank digital currencies among the g7.,Pro-CBDC
"see for example central bank digital currencies: a monetary anchor for digital innovation, speech by fabio panetta, member of the executive board of the ecb, at the elcano royal institute, madrid, 5 november 2021.",Wait-and-See
"the scope of digital euro basic services is yet to be defined, but it should be similar in nature to the basic services that banks are required to provide under the payment accounts directive .",Wait-and-See
"this is entirely separate from the decision on whether or not to issue a digital euro, which will only be taken once the legislative process has concluded.",Wait-and-See
"the times they are a'changin' cbdc lately, central bankers have rapidly started to tinker with something called the central bank digital currency or, shortly, the cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"another risk is a potential for market distortion that lies in the introduction of the digital euro when a public institution enters the private market, disrupts it and even competes with both current and future market participants.",Anti-CBDC
"it is slow, expensive and opaque, and the cbdc could play a significant role here to make it cheaper, faster and more transparent.",Pro-CBDC
but the risks of internationalised or cross-border cbdcs for developing economies could be large and unintended.,Anti-CBDC
in such cases the citizens could substitute local currencies with the digital euro and make the domestic financial situation even worse.,Anti-CBDC
"the rba is also investigating new forms of digital money, including a central bank digital currency.",Wait-and-See
"this central bank digital currency is being used by the industry to explore possible use cases, and we are very interested to see the results.",Pro-CBDC
"retail cbdc, stablecoins, tokenized deposits, fast payments are all good candidates.",Pro-CBDC
cbdc is uncharted territory for central banks.,Wait-and-See
"however, the digital euro is not a german idea.",Wait-and-See
a cbdc could form a counterweight to that challenge.,Pro-CBDC
"and when it comes to the customer relationship, private actors can leverage their vast experience at the front end and their innovative power by providing the digital wallets needed to store a cbdc, for example.",Pro-CBDC
"one aspect is whether a digital euro would also receive the status of legal tender, like cash, which would make sense from my point of view.",Pro-CBDC
"in autumn 2023, the governing council of the ecb will take a decision on whether to enter a preparation phase for the digital euro.",Wait-and-See
"when people ask me when a digital euro would be ready for distribution among users, i remain cautious: we are talking about a minimum of three years, so probably not before 2027.",Wait-and-See
"without a doubt, a cbdc is just one of many steps towards making that a reality.",Pro-CBDC

"closing in closing, i would say that project e-hkd is a hugely complex and challenging undertaking.",Wait-and-See
"we believe that cbdcs, by the very fact that they are issued by central banks, will provide a springboard for enhancing digital financial literacy.",Pro-CBDC
"one of the major stumbling blocks in my opinion is coming to terms with the notion that a cbdc cannot be a ""near-cash"" option.",Wait-and-See
a cbdc must be construed as a type of payment instrument to be made available to one and all.,Pro-CBDC
"as a matter of fact, the success of cbdcs hinges on awareness.",Pro-CBDC
"that is why it is critical that central banks collaborate with each other, and with international institutions, as well as with their respective stakeholders for meaningful implementation of cbdcs.",Pro-CBDC
this handbook stands as a beacon for central banks along their journey towards creating and rolling out their respective cbdc.,Pro-CBDC

let me be very categorical on this point: a digital euro will not lead to disintermediation.,Pro-CBDC
losing this public anchor - in a world of digital payments without cbdc - would ultimately mean jeopardising this private trust.,Pro-CBDC
"ï‚· in addition, in central banking, the development of ""wholesale"" cbdc would appear to be just as important as the digital retail euro in extending the anchoring role of central bank money in the tokenised sphere, by securing interbank settlements and financial transactions.",Pro-CBDC
we have demonstrated that wholesale cbdc could facilitate interoperability between different dlt platforms developed by the public or private sector as well as with existing settlement systems.,Pro-CBDC
"a second question is, are we therefore talking about central bank digital money?",Wait-and-See
"we are exploring the case for retail central bank digital currency, and we jointly lead a cbdc taskforce with the treasury.",Pro-CBDC

"incidentally, whoever painted ""no to cbdc"" on a motorway bridge, i can only apologise to the cumbria biodiversity data centre.",Wait-and-See
this puts us in a very strong position to deliver solutions which can integrate central bank digital money in rtgs with tokenised transactions.,Pro-CBDC
the digital euro should be used as a payment instrument and not for saving purposes.,Pro-CBDC
the introduction of synchronised settlement would put us in a strong position to integrate central bank digital money in rtgs with innovative technologies (such as distributed ledger).,Pro-CBDC
india is one of the few countries which have launched cbdc pilots in both wholesale and retail segments.,Pro-CBDC
"with its instant settlement feature, i believe, cbdcs can play an important role in making cross-border payments cheaper, faster and more secure.",Pro-CBDC
"i strongly believe, cross-border payments can be made more efficient through adoption of cbdcs and this is an area which should receive close attention.",Pro-CBDC
"while retail cbdcs can improve financial inclusion and payment efficiency, wholesale cbdcs can potentially reduce the costs of cross-border payments and increase the speed to nearly real-time, which has the potential to profoundly transform the global payments landscape.",Pro-CBDC
"measures have also been taken to put in place state-of-the- art market infrastructure, pilot launch of central bank digital currency (cbdc) and internationalisation of the rupee.",Pro-CBDC
"as you would be aware, rbi has commenced pilot runs of india's cbdc (e-rupee) for specific use cases in both wholesale and retail segments.",Pro-CBDC
"17. the cbdc-retail pilot was launched on december 1, 2022 and covers both person to person (p2p) and person to merchant (p2m) transactions.",Pro-CBDC
"recently, we have enabled full inter-operability of cbdc with upi qr codes and are targeting one million cbdc transactions per day by december 2023. this will give us enough data points to study various design choices, use cases and also behavioural pattern.",Pro-CBDC
"the research into cbdcs is a priority for many central banks worldwide, and for a good reason.",Pro-CBDC
"given these profound implications, at the hkma we have been extensively involved in cbdc research at both the wholesale and the retail level, in order to future-proof our economy, as our ""fintech 2025"" strategy eloquently puts it.",Pro-CBDC

"today i will share my views on several of these potential improvements, including cbdc, other digital assets, and wholesale payments innovations.",Pro-CBDC
"as i have noted before in other venues, there are two threshold questions that a policymaker should ask when contemplating a cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"it is quite possible that other proposed solutions may address many or all of the problems that a cbdc would address, but in a more effective and efficient way.",Anti-CBDC
"further, the potential benefits of a u.s. cbdc remain unclear, and the introduction of a u.s. cbdc could pose significant risks and tradeoffs for the financial system.",Anti-CBDC
"however, given that we have a safe and efficient payment system and a well-functioning banking system, the potential uses of a u.s. cbdc remain unclear and, at the same time, could introduce significant risks and tradeoffs.",Anti-CBDC
stablecoins but a cbdc is just one potential piece of the evolving payments landscape.,Wait-and-See
"another alternative to traditional forms of money and payment, or to a cbdc, is stablecoins.",Wait-and-See

"i also share the view that cbdcs could usefully serve as a foundation, providing stability and facilitating transfers between wallets and different payment types.",Pro-CBDC
"this is one reason why around 90% of central banks around the world are currently working on projects concerning central bank digital currency, or cbdc (central bank digital currency) for short.",Pro-CBDC
i will then spend a bit of time outlining some of the risks that the introduction of cbdc (central bank digital currency) could bring with it and explain how we intend to address those risks.,Wait-and-See
"by contrast, the digital euro - being the digital equivalent of cash - would give people more choice in how they pay in the digital sphere.",Pro-CBDC
"and as far as the digital euro is concerned, what concerns people most is the disclosure of their personal information.",Wait-and-See
people often share their concerns that the introduction of the digital euro will lead to significant rollbacks in privacy in the payments space.,Anti-CBDC
"the digital euro, on the other hand, would guarantee the highest-possible levels of privacy in the digital space.",Pro-CBDC
"to avoid that, there are plans to set a holding limit for digital euro.",Pro-CBDC
the exact amount would only be set by the eurosystem shortly before the digital euro is issued.,Wait-and-See
"the eurosystem should not become a commercial bank for the people of europe, hence our plan to issue digital euro, but not distribute it.",Pro-CBDC
this does not yet mean that the digital euro will be introduced - i would expect that to happen in four to five years' time at the earliest.,Wait-and-See

"fourth, as with the digital pound, we cannot know in advance the speed and scale of adoption of such new forms of money and payments.",Wait-and-See
"the level of such limits, however, has not yet been decided, as this will require rigorous analysis that takes into consideration the economic conditions prevailing in the euro area if and when a digital euro is ultimately launched.",Wait-and-See
the waterfall approach would enable users to receive payments in digital euro that push the balance above the holding limit.,Pro-CBDC
"but it does make sense to limit holdings, as we are specifically trying to avoid the digital euro being used as a store of value.",Pro-CBDC
"the eurosystem has weighed up the possibility of reusing the existing settlement infrastructure, but the particularities of the digital euro (number of users, transaction volume, privacy requirements, etc.)",Pro-CBDC
"other matters will also be examined over the next two years, such as how to ensure the optimal user experience and digital euro access for everyone that wants it, irrespective of their level of financial and digital inclusion.",Pro-CBDC
i must also state that any decision on issuing a digital euro would always be conditional on the existence of an appropriate regulatory framework.,Wait-and-See
what we do know is that any decision on issuing a digital euro must wait for such legislative framework to be adopted.,Wait-and-See
"if and when the digital euro is issued, its success will undoubtedly hinge on it fulfilling users' expectations.",Pro-CBDC
"in these circumstances, issuing a digital euro is not naturally perceived to be a pressing need.",Anti-CBDC
so let me focus on the counterfactual - the consequences of not issuing cbdcs - using the digital euro as a case study.,Pro-CBDC
but there are sceptics today who claim that issuing cbdcs would be fruitless.,Anti-CBDC
some believe that a digital euro may not be successful enough; many ask what specific benefits it could offer that existing payment methods do not already provide.,Anti-CBDC

"digital euro holdings will not be remunerated, in line with the nonremuneration of cash.",Pro-CBDC
"for starters, there are concerns about the impact of cbdcs on financial stability and on the banking system.",Anti-CBDC
"let me assure you that a digital euro would not upend the healthy equilibrium that has existed for decades between bank deposits and central bank money, between private money and public money.",Pro-CBDC
the digital euro would be designed as a means of payment and not as a store of value.,Pro-CBDC
"next to concerns about their potential impact on financial stability, some parts of the population question our motives for developing cbdcs.",Anti-CBDC
"in europe, it is currently up to the colegislators to give the green light to the digital euro.",Wait-and-See
"it is clear that different jurisdictions working on cbdcs have different social and political systems, and with that, different understandings of privacy.",Wait-and-See
why do we need a central bank digital currency?',Wait-and-See
"this is often referred to as wholesale central bank digital currency, or wholesale cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"four bond issuances, from the cantons of baselstadt and zurich and from the cities of lugano and st gallen, were successfully settled with wholesale cbdc as part of the pilot.",Pro-CBDC

"the pilot also shows that the banks, the infrastructure providers and the snb can accommodate wholesale cbdc in their internalprocesses.",Pro-CBDC
these and other questions need to be explored before we can make a decision on the introduction of swiss franc wholesale cbdc.,Wait-and-See
"from a swiss perspective, the risks of retail cbdc currently outweigh its potential benefits.",Anti-CBDC
"helvetia iii, the snb's pilot for swiss franc wholesale cbdc, and the introduction of instant payments with the new version of sic are two concrete examples.",Pro-CBDC
"hence, the bank of england and hm treasury (like many other countries around the world) are exploring whether or not to issue a retail cbdc in the uk.",Wait-and-See
but this uncertainty and the severity of the impact should it crystallise is an important motivation for our exploration of a retail cbdc.,Pro-CBDC
let me emphasise - we have not taken any decision on whether or not to issue a digital pound.,Wait-and-See
"indeed, key inputs into any decision to proceed with a retail cbdc will be the nature and scale of innovation in other forms of retail money (in particular, commercial bank money), as well as how our own wholesale payments infrastructure might evolve in support.",Wait-and-See
"in response, some 130 central banks have been conducting research on cbdcs as an advanced representation of central bank money for the digital economy.",Pro-CBDC
"the hkma is an early mover in this respect, having started cbdc explorations since 2017 with project lionrock, which has since evolved into project mbridge, one of the more advanced explorations of a multi-cbdc platform globally.",Pro-CBDC
"from a more technical perspective, a retail cbdc could serve as a fundamental layer to facilitate interoperability and interlinking between various entities participating in our future digital economy.",Pro-CBDC
"we also envision that a retail cbdc could be a potential ""backbone"" and anchor, bridging a legal tender and digital assets, offering price stability and confidence needed to empower more innovations, and developing a vibrant sector and ecosystem for digital assets in hong kong.",Pro-CBDC
"having said that, while a retail cbdc may represent a more advanced version of cash, it remains to be seen whether the benefits of its issuance would outweigh the risks.",Wait-and-See
"given the generally efficient and competitive retail payment ecosystem in hong kong, we will continue to take a usecase driven approach in thinking about whether and when to introduce a retail cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"the digital version of this arrangement has been explored as a cbdc-backed stablecoin under project aurum, and some economists have recently called this a ""reserve-backed token"".",Pro-CBDC

participating banks can use swiss franc wholesale cbdc to settle transactions with tokenised bonds on six digital exchange (sdx).,Pro-CBDC

issuing wholesale cbdc on a third-party platform entails a public-private partnership.,Pro-CBDC

"in helvetia iii, participating banks tokenise sight deposits and de-tokenise wholesale cbdc through the swiss rtgs system in a standardised, automated process.",Wait-and-See
de-tokenising wholesale cbdc on one platform and tokenising sight deposits on another would use the same process and would be facilitated by the swiss rtgs system.,Wait-and-See
"compared to wholesale cbdc and sight deposits, however, backed private token money is not a direct claim on the central bank, and thus requires a thorough analysis with regard to its regulatory treatment.",Wait-and-See

central bank digital currency - including wholesale currency - will be a partner in this respect and not an adversary.,Pro-CBDC

one objection that we hear time and time again is that the eurosystem could use the digital euro to monitor or even control the people in the euro area.,Anti-CBDC
"the fourth of my five factors that make the case for a digital euro is that the digital euro would provide the highest possible level of privacy, surpassed only by cash.",Pro-CBDC

a further 21 countries have launched a pilot cbdc and 27 countries are working on a proof of concept.,Pro-CBDC
"one key question is whether our ""analogue core product"" of cash should be complemented by a central bank digital currency, or cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"if so, we need to decide whether to issue cbdc for the general public or for payment professionals like financial institutions.",Wait-and-See
but let me first say a few words on wholesale cbdc.,Wait-and-See
this shows that solutions for wholesale cbdc could be an important step for our future financial system.,Pro-CBDC
"2 why we need a digital euro the digital euro is currently in the ""preparation phase"", as it is called.",Wait-and-See
i am aware that some people have their reservations about the digital euro project.,Wait-and-See
one of the main arguments against a digital euro is that we do not need it at all.,Anti-CBDC
"only 41 percent of respondents said they had already heard, read or seen anything about the digital euro.",Wait-and-See
"as long as the final decision on the digital euro has not been taken, it makes little sense for the eurosystem to launch a large-scale public awareness drive.",Wait-and-See
all the others either don't know about the digital euro or don't have a clear picture of it.,Wait-and-See
"such misconceptions are certainly related, in part, to negative campaigns and fake news about the digital euro.",Pro-CBDC
"moreover, i am confident that many of those who currently cannot imagine using the digital euro will change their minds once they see it in practice.",Pro-CBDC
"like with cash.3 5 conclusion ladies and gentlemen, there is still a long way to go before we can issue the digital euro.",Wait-and-See
central bank digital currency (cbdc) project another transformative project of the bsp that will impact large-value financial transactions is the central bank digital currency (cbdc) project.,Pro-CBDC
"given the innovations of wholesale cbdcs, the bsp views that it may yield significant efficiency improvements to mitigate frictions in cross-border payments, securities settlement, and intraday liquidity facilities.",Pro-CBDC
"we are now assessing and evaluating potential use cases wherein we can strategically implement wholesale cbdc, exploring its applicability and advantages in diverse financial scenarios through ""project agila.""",Pro-CBDC
the first one is central bank digital currency (cbdc) - legal tender or fiat currency issued by a central bank in a digital form.,Wait-and-See
"the major advantages of cbdcs are the finality of transactions (settlement risks is eliminated as there is no bank intermediation), and real-time and cost effective globalisation of payment systems.",Pro-CBDC
the impact of cbdc on deposits and hence deposit insurance is largely unknown as of today.,Anti-CBDC
"for instance, we are exploring the potential of wholesale cbdc to improve cross-border payments while facilitating local currency settlement for trade and investment activities.",Pro-CBDC
the digital lilangeni is a retail cbdc that is designed to ensure that emaswati continue to have access to central bank money even when transacting digitally.,Pro-CBDC
"as part of the process, the project team conducted a proof of concept (poc) with bank staff to gain real life user experience of the cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
the poc was extended to the eswatini international trade fair where emaswati got an opportunity to learn about cbdcs and got first-hand experience on the practical usage of cbdcs.,Pro-CBDC
this marked a significant milestone for the bank as this meant using the cbdc in a live environment.,Pro-CBDC
this collaborative effort provided the bank with invaluable hands-on experience in developing a cbdc solution.,Pro-CBDC
the bank has made significant progress in understanding cbdcs and will continue with the research and capacity building.,Pro-CBDC
"this included a paper that has been written jointly with the australian treasury, providing a stocktake and roadmap on domestic research priorities relating to the concept of central bank digital currency.",Pro-CBDC
the programmability feature of cbdc could serve as a key enabler for financial inclusion by ensuring delivery of funds to the targeted user.,Pro-CBDC
yet another path 7 breaking use case is farmers getting purpose bound money through programmable cbdc for generation of carbon credits.,Pro-CBDC
"14. it is important to emphasise that there should not be in any rush to roll out systemwide cbdc before one acquires a comprehensive understanding of its impact on users, on monetary policy, on the financial system and on the economy.",Wait-and-See
actual introduction of cbdc can be phased in gradually.,Pro-CBDC
"undoubtedly, cbdc has the potential to underpin the payment systems of future, both for domestic payments and also cross-border payments.",Pro-CBDC
"20. ideally, while the legacy payment systems should be able to connect to each other and so should the cbdc systems, one country's legacy system should also be interoperable with another country's cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
"since 2017, the hkma has been at the forefront of research and innovation on cbdcs, with projects like mbridge, which has recently reached the minimum viable product (mvp) stage, and e-hkd, which will commence its phase 2 pilot programme shortly.",Pro-CBDC
"but we recognise that cbdcs will not, and should not, be the only force driving innovation.",Wait-and-See

"first, and with the strong endorsement of the payments system board, i can confirm that the rba is making a strategic commitment to prioritise its work agenda on wholesale digital money and infrastructure - including wholesale cbdc - rather than retail cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
"at the present time, we assess the benefits to the economy as more promising, and the challenges less problematic, for a wholesale cbdc compared to a retail version.",Pro-CBDC
"this recognises that unlike a retail cbdc that would be issued for use among the public, a wholesale cbdc would represent more an evolution than revolution in our monetary arrangements.",Pro-CBDC
our most immediate priority is to launch a new project with industry on wholesale cbdc and tokenised commercial bank deposits.,Pro-CBDC
"it is reasonable to ask at this point: if, as in many other advanced economies, digital money is already so dominant in australia, then what is the big deal about cbdc?",Wait-and-See
this might also explain why public debates over retail cbdc have been hotly contested in some parts of the world.,Wait-and-See
"our assessment is that the potential benefits of a retail cbdc generally appear modest or uncertain at the present time, relative to the challenges it would introduce.",Anti-CBDC
"most of the arguments made internationally in support of a retail cbdc (set out in bold below) reflect issues that are either of limited relevance to australia, or where it is not obvious that a retail cbdc would best address them.",Anti-CBDC
survey-based research by rba staff suggests that australian households would not attach economic value to the risk-less nature of a cbdc.,Anti-CBDC
"71 that said, the extent to which a retail cbdc could further reduce payment costs is yet to be fully assessed and would depend on design choices.",Wait-and-See
a final argument sometimes offered in favour of a retail cbdc is that it could open up access to financial services.,Pro-CBDC
{21 further work is therefore needed to understand how a retail cbdc could address these issues - at the present time it is not obvious.,Wait-and-See
"if the potential benefits of a retail cbdc in australia appear modest or uncertain at present, what about the drawbacks?",Anti-CBDC
"should households place their liquid assets in a retail cbdc rather than bank deposits, banks would have to offer higher deposit rates and/or tap more volatile and costly sources of funding - costs that could be passed on to borrowers.",Anti-CBDC
"a more significant concern is that a retail cbdc could increase the risk, or amplify the effects, of bank runs.",Anti-CBDC
"in times of stress, access to a risk-free cbdc would increase the ability of panicked households to switch out of bank deposits en masse.",Anti-CBDC
the events at silicon valley bank last year offered a cautionary tale over the risk of rapid-fire bank runs in the digital age - one that could be magnified if bank deposits were convertible into cbdc at the touch of a smartphone.,Anti-CBDC
"[12 central banks have examined measures that could forestall or limit the effects of bank runs involving cbdc, including limits on holdings, penalties on bank deposit withdrawals and negative interest rates on cbdc in periods of stress.",Wait-and-See
"but what such measures have in common is an effort to restrict the use of cbdc, which to my mind at least, raises the question of whether the benefits of a cbdc would be forfeited in the process.",Anti-CBDC
"like es balances, a wholesale cbdc would be issued to eligible financial institutions and serve as the ultimate safe asset in the settlement of wholesale market transactions.",Pro-CBDC
"it may well be that a significant efficiency uplift in trading, clearing and settlement in our wholesale markets can be achieved without the issuance of a wholesale cbdc.",Anti-CBDC
"project acacia aims to build on the lessons from our cbdc pilot last year by focussing on opportunities to uplift the efficiency, transparency and resilience of wholesale markets through tokenised money and new settlement infrastructure.",Pro-CBDC
"a second step is to launch industry and academic cbdc advisory forums in the first half of 2025, covering both retail and wholesale cbdc issues.",Pro-CBDC
"as such, the australian government would ultimately decide whether to introduce a retail cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"but recognizing that there is not currently a compelling case to move forward with a cbdc in canada, the bank is scaling down its work on a retail central bank digital currency and shifting its focus to broader payments system research and policy development.",Anti-CBDC
the bank will continue to monitor global retail cbdc developments.,Wait-and-See
it will be of outmost importance to factor in the risks stemming from quantum computing when designing the central bank digital currencies.,Wait-and-See
cbdc is an issue that is keeping almost all central banks very busy at the moment.,Wait-and-See
"however, introducing a cbdc could also have unintended side effects.",Anti-CBDC
"and if cbdc were too attractive a substitute for deposits, commercial banks' access to retail deposits could erode over time.",Anti-CBDC
it is therefore of the essence to design cbdc in a way that prevents these risks from materialising.,Wait-and-See
this stands in contrast to the intention of the governing council not to remunerate digital euro holdings.4 why are we not in favour of remuneration?,Pro-CBDC
"we neither want to compete with commercial banks for deposits, nor do we want to employ the digital euro as a monetary policy instrument.",Pro-CBDC
"we intend to limit digital euro holdings to a certain amount, because we want to ensure the digital euro does not lead to large sudden shifts or disintermediation.",Pro-CBDC
they can then convert their bank deposits into digital euro automatically and instantly if their holdings are insufficient to make a payment.,Pro-CBDC
"however, digital bank runs can happen even without cbdc.",Wait-and-See
"what the digital euro is intended to deliver-and what not , interview with focus online, 5 june.",Wait-and-See
"another ground-breaking initiative is project mbridge, which is a multi-central bank digital currency (cbdc) platform shared among participating central banks and commercial banks.",Pro-CBDC
"with rmb being one of the cbdcs used on mbridge, this provides another opportunity to allow the easier use of rmb in cross-border payment, and hong kong as an offshore hub stands to benefit from its success.",Pro-CBDC
brazil and india did not need cbdcs to develop the world's two most-used retail digital systems.,Anti-CBDC
"for this purpose, the concept of a unified ledger is a logical way forward for the initial cbdc and tokenisation initiatives.",Pro-CBDC
many players seem reluctant to take this step because of the uncertainty surrounding the future of a central bank digital currency settlement solution for tokenised assets.,Wait-and-See
"a cbdc-based solution would provide an important lever in supporting the transition enabled by the pilot programme, and we have already developed our own blockchain, dl3s, for this purpose.",Pro-CBDC
"i am thinking in particular of the agoraÌ project, which focuses on cbdc and commercial bank money for cross-border payments.",Pro-CBDC
central bank digital currencies (cbdcs) is another area which has the potential to facilitate efficient cross-border payments.,Pro-CBDC
india is one of the few countries that have launched both wholesale and retail cbdcs.,Pro-CBDC
"programmability, interoperability with the upi retail fast payment system and development of offline solutions for remote areas and underserved segments of the population, are some of the value added services which we are now experimenting as part of our cbdc pilot.",Pro-CBDC
"going forward, harmonisation of standards and interoperability would be important for cbdcs for cross-border payments and to overcome the serious financial stability concerns associated with cryptocurrencies.",Pro-CBDC
"however, it now appears there may be another revolution on the horizon - this time involving payments in central bank money: the introduction of central bank digital currencies (cbdc).",Pro-CBDC
"first, i will outline some general points about the potential impact and benefits of the introduction of cbdc for processing cross-border transactions.",Pro-CBDC
the introduction of cbdcs would facilitate a setup of new infrastructures for digital payments.,Pro-CBDC
"in my view, we have a historic opportunity to vastly improve cross-border transactions by making different cbdcs interoperable from the very beginning.",Pro-CBDC
"as i understand it, the rbi intends to tap the potential for using cbdcs in cross-border payments as well.",Pro-CBDC
this means that banks and other payment providers should assume the role of the cbdc interface between the eurosystem and the customers.,Pro-CBDC
"however, this is currently a vision for the future, since, as already mentioned, we first have to overcome numerous challenges to establish a retail digital euro that works within the euro area.",Wait-and-See
the scepticism about cbdcs in many quarters is not uncommon for many technological innovations.,Wait-and-See
and so we will continue our efforts to implement cbdcs.,Pro-CBDC
this is a key motivation behind the digital euro project: bringing central bank money into the digital age would provide a digital equivalent to banknotes and strengthen our monetary sovereignty.,Pro-CBDC
"in the future, all stores would be required to accept the digital euro, meaning payment terminals would need to support its standard.",Pro-CBDC
this would mean that all payment terminals in europe that support digital euro transactions would be equipped with a scheme-agnostic kernel.,Pro-CBDC
"accordingly, the banque de france was one of the first central banks to launch an ambitious experimental program focused on the use of wholesale central bank digital currency (cbdc) in various settlement processes for varied assets.",Pro-CBDC
"we have also intensively contributed to the preparation underway of a retail cbdc, namely the digital euro.",Pro-CBDC
"on the wholesale side, a cbdc would appropriately accompany and secure a trend towards the tokenisation of financial assets.",Pro-CBDC
"the final step is to ask whether other things really are equal, or whether there are reasons why in the retail space, digital payments need to be done in a newly created central bank digital currency?",Wait-and-See
"for me, this justifies why we must continue to prepare for retail cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
"a common settlement asset is one that is agreed by transacting parties, and can be credit-risk free such as a wholesale cbdc.",Pro-CBDC
"our view is that when asset tokenisation activity grows and eventually hits critical mass in key asset classes, this will drive demand for wholesale cbdcs as a common settlement asset.",Pro-CBDC
the final decision on whether or not to issue a digital euro will only be taken once european legislators have defined its legal framework.,Wait-and-See
"in the wake of project mariana, where we tested the cross-border exchange of cbdc, we are currently working together on project rialto to improve the fx layer of instant crossborder payments.",Pro-CBDC
"in september, we published a paper with treasury that set out our assessment of the case for central bank digital currency (cbdc) in australia, and for the first time laid out 3 a three-year roadmap for future work.",Pro-CBDC
"at present, we assess the benefits to the economy as more promising, and the challenges less problematic, for a wholesale cbdc compared with a retail version that would be available to the general public.",Pro-CBDC
"as i recently discussed, the rba has made a strategic commitment to prioritise our applied research on the role that cbdc could play in lifting the efficiency and resilience 4 of wholesale markets in australia.",Pro-CBDC
"in other words, what market failure or inefficiency demands this specific intervention?2 in more than three years, i have yet to hear a satisfactory answer as applied to cbdc.",Anti-CBDC
"jordan, t. (2024), project helvetia iii - the snb's pilot for wholesale cbdc, remarks at the bis innovation summit, 6-8 may.",Wait-and-See
we leverage on the technology to explore the use of central bank digital currency to raise the efficiency and lower the cost of crossborder payments.,Pro-CBDC
"our flagship project, the multi-cbdc platform mbridge is a very good example.",Pro-CBDC
one example is the provision of a secure pan-european payment infrastructure offering central bank digital money.,Pro-CBDC
"for the payments system, a pan-european payment infrastructure via central bank digital money will provide the rails to both deepen and strengthen the single market, while also providing opportunities for innovation in payments and other financial services.",Pro-CBDC
"a central element of this program is determining whether there is a public policy case to introduce a central bank digital currency (cbdc) in australia, and if so, in what form.",Wait-and-See
"at the present time, we see the potential benefits of a retail cbdc as modest or uncertain, relative to the challenges it would likely introduce.",Anti-CBDC
"like a number of central banks in advanced economies, we see the potential case for a wholesale cbdc as more promising, though not definitive at this point.",Pro-CBDC
"a wholesale cbdc could have a key role in facilitating the settlement of transactions in tokenised asset markets, and in enhancing cross-border payments.",Pro-CBDC
implementing a wholesale cbdc is also likely to be less disruptive and pose fewer policy challenges than issuing a retail cbdc.,Pro-CBDC
"in that respect, we have made a strategic commitment to prioritise our applied research agenda on innovations in wholesale digital money - namely, wholesale cbdc, tokenised bank deposits and stablecoins.",Pro-CBDC
"in addition to project acacia, we have a number of other cbdc initiatives in line over the next year.",Pro-CBDC
